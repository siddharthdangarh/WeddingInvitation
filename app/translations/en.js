    storyPara1: "Our story began in the corridors of school when Pooja transferred to our class in 8th standard. Little did we know that sharing the same school, participating in school activities, and growing up together through our teenage years would one day lead to something so beautiful.",
    storyPara2: "Life took an unexpected but delightful turn when our families approached us with the prospect of an arranged marriage. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that our childhood schoolmate would become our life partner! While it took some time to process this wonderful coincidence, we gradually discovered new dimensions to each other's personalities that we had never noticed before.",
    storyPara3: "From being schoolmates to soulmates, our journey has been uniquely beautiful. We're excited to begin this new chapter of our lives with the blessings of our families who helped write this destined love story.",
